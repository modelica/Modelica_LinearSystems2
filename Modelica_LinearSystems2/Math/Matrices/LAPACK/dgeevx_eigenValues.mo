   Purpose
   =======

   DGEEVX computes for an N-by-N real nonsymmetric matrix A, the
   eigenvalues and, optionally, the left and/or right eigenvectors.

   Optionally also, it computes a balancing transformation to improve
   the conditioning of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors (ILO, IHI,
   SCALE, and ABNRM), reciprocal condition numbers for the eigenvalues
   (RCONDE), and reciprocal condition numbers for the right
   eigenvectors (RCONDV).

   The right eigenvector v(j) of A satisfies
                    A * v(j) = lambda(j) * v(j)
   where lambda(j) is its eigenvalue.
   The left eigenvector u(j) of A satisfies
                 u(j)**H * A = lambda(j) * u(j)**H
   where u(j)**H denotes the conjugate transpose of u(j).

   The computed eigenvectors are normalized to have Euclidean norm
   equal to 1 and largest component real.

   Balancing a matrix means permuting the rows and columns to make it
   more nearly upper triangular, and applying a diagonal similarity
   transformation D * A * D**(-1), where D is a diagonal matrix, to
   make its rows and columns closer in norm and the condition numbers
   of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors smaller.  The computed
   reciprocal condition numbers correspond to the balanced matrix.
   Permuting rows and columns will not change the condition numbers
   (in exact arithmetic) but diagonal scaling will.  For further
   explanation of balancing, see section 4.10.2 of the LAPACK
   Users' Guide.

   Arguments
   =========

   BALANC  (input) CHARACTER*1
           Indicates how the input matrix should be diagonally scaled
           and/or permuted to improve the conditioning of its
           eigenvalues.
           = 'N': Do not diagonally scale or permute;
           = 'P': Perform permutations to make the matrix more nearly
                  upper triangular. Do not diagonally scale;
           = 'S': Diagonally scale the matrix, i.e. replace A by
                  D*A*D**(-1), where D is a diagonal matrix chosen
                  to make the rows and columns of A more equal in
                  norm. Do not permute;
           = 'B': Both diagonally scale and permute A.

           Computed reciprocal condition numbers will be for the matrix
           after balancing and/or permuting. Permuting does not change
           condition numbers (in exact arithmetic), but balancing does.

   JOBVL   (input) CHARACTER*1
           = 'N': left eigenvectors of A are not computed;
           = 'V': left eigenvectors of A are computed.
           If SENSE = 'E' or 'B', JOBVL must = 'V'.

   JOBVR   (input) CHARACTER*1
           = 'N': right eigenvectors of A are not computed;
           = 'V': right eigenvectors of A are computed.
           If SENSE = 'E' or 'B', JOBVR must = 'V'.

   SENSE   (input) CHARACTER*1
           Determines which reciprocal condition numbers are computed.
           = 'N': None are computed;
           = 'E': Computed for eigenvalues only;
           = 'V': Computed for right eigenvectors only;
           = 'B': Computed for eigenvalues and right eigenvectors.

           If SENSE = 'E' or 'B', both left and right eigenvectors
           must also be computed (JOBVL = 'V' and JOBVR = 'V').

   N       (input) INTEGER
           The order of the matrix A. N >= 0.

   A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
           On entry, the N-by-N matrix A.
           On exit, A has been overwritten.  If JOBVL = 'V' or
           JOBVR = 'V', A contains the real Schur form of the balanced
           version of the input matrix A.

   LDA     (input) INTEGER
           The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

   WR      (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
   WI      (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
           WR and WI contain the real and imaginary parts,
           respectively, of the computed eigenvalues.  Complex
           conjugate pairs of eigenvalues will appear consecutively
           with the eigenvalue having the positive imaginary part
           first.

   VL      (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDVL,N)
           If JOBVL = 'V', the left eigenvectors u(j) are stored one
           after another in the columns of VL, in the same order
           as their eigenvalues.
           If JOBVL = 'N', VL is not referenced.
           If the j-th eigenvalue is real, then u(j) = VL(:,j),
           the j-th column of VL.
           If the j-th and (j+1)-st eigenvalues form a complex
           conjugate pair, then u(j) = VL(:,j) + i*VL(:,j+1) and
           u(j+1) = VL(:,j) - i*VL(:,j+1).

   LDVL    (input) INTEGER
           The leading dimension of the array VL.  LDVL >= 1; if
           JOBVL = 'V', LDVL >= N.

   VR      (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDVR,N)
           If JOBVR = 'V', the right eigenvectors v(j) are stored one
           after another in the columns of VR, in the same order
           as their eigenvalues.
           If JOBVR = 'N', VR is not referenced.
           If the j-th eigenvalue is real, then v(j) = VR(:,j),
           the j-th column of VR.
           If the j-th and (j+1)-st eigenvalues form a complex
           conjugate pair, then v(j) = VR(:,j) + i*VR(:,j+1) and
           v(j+1) = VR(:,j) - i*VR(:,j+1).

   LDVR    (input) INTEGER
           The leading dimension of the array VR.  LDVR >= 1, and if
           JOBVR = 'V', LDVR >= N.

   ILO,IHI (output) INTEGER
           ILO and IHI are integer values determined when A was
           balanced.  The balanced A(i,j) = 0 if I > J and
           J = 1,...,ILO-1 or I = IHI+1,...,N.

   SCALE   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
           Details of the permutations and scaling factors applied
           when balancing A.  If P(j) is the index of the row and column
           interchanged with row and column j, and D(j) is the scaling
           factor applied to row and column j, then
           SCALE(J) = P(J),    for J = 1,...,ILO-1
                    = D(J),    for J = ILO,...,IHI
                    = P(J)     for J = IHI+1,...,N.
           The order in which the interchanges are made is N to IHI+1,
           then 1 to ILO-1.

   ABNRM   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
           The one-norm of the balanced matrix (the maximum
           of the sum of absolute values of elements of any column).

   RCONDE  (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
           RCONDE(j) is the reciprocal condition number of the j-th
           eigenvalue.

   RCONDV  (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
           RCONDV(j) is the reciprocal condition number of the j-th
           right eigenvector.

   WORK    (workspace/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LWORK)
           On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.

   LWORK   (input) INTEGER
           The dimension of the array WORK.   If SENSE = 'N' or 'E',
           LWORK >= max(1,2*N), and if JOBVL = 'V' or JOBVR = 'V',
           LWORK >= 3*N.  If SENSE = 'V' or 'B', LWORK >= N*(N+6).
           For good performance, LWORK must generally be larger.

           If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
           only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
           this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
           message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

   IWORK   (workspace) INTEGER array, dimension (2*N-2)
           If SENSE = 'N' or 'E', not referenced.

   INFO    (output) INTEGER
           = 0:  successful exit
           < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
           > 0:  if INFO = i, the QR algorithm failed to compute all the
                 eigenvalues, and no eigenvectors or condition numbers
                 have been computed; elements 1:ILO-1 and i+1:N of WR
                 and WI contain eigenvalues which have converged.
