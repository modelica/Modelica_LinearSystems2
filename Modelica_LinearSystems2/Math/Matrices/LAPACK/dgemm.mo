   Purpose
   =======

   DGEMM  performs one of the matrix-matrix operations
      C := alpha*op( A )*op( B ) + beta*C,
   where  op( X ) is one of
      op( X ) = X   or   op( X ) = X',
   alpha and beta are scalars, and A, B and C are matrices, with op( A )
   an m by k matrix,  op( B )  a  k by n matrix and  C an m by n matrix.

   Arguments
   ==========

   TRANSA - CHARACTER*1.
            On entry, TRANSA specifies the form of op( A ) to be used in
            the matrix multiplication as follows:
               TRANSA = 'N' or 'n',  op( A ) = A.
               TRANSA = 'T' or 't',  op( A ) = A'.
               TRANSA = 'C' or 'c',  op( A ) = A'.
            Unchanged on exit.
   TRANSB - CHARACTER*1.
            On entry, TRANSB specifies the form of op( B ) to be used in
            the matrix multiplication as follows:
               TRANSB = 'N' or 'n',  op( B ) = B.
               TRANSB = 'T' or 't',  op( B ) = B'.
               TRANSB = 'C' or 'c',  op( B ) = B'.
            Unchanged on exit.
   M      - INTEGER.
            On entry,  M  specifies  the number  of rows  of the  matrix
            op( A )  and of the  matrix  C.  M  must  be at least  zero.
            Unchanged on exit.
   N      - INTEGER.
            On entry,  N  specifies the number  of columns of the matrix
            op( B ) and the number of columns of the matrix C. N must be
            at least zero.
            Unchanged on exit.
   K      - INTEGER.
            On entry,  K  specifies  the number of columns of the matrix
            op( A ) and the number of rows of the matrix op( B ). K must
            be at least  zero.
            Unchanged on exit.
   ALPHA  - DOUBLE PRECISION.
            On entry, ALPHA specifies the scalar alpha.
            Unchanged on exit.
   A      - DOUBLE PRECISION array of DIMENSION ( LDA, ka ), where ka is
            k  when  TRANSA = 'N' or 'n',  and is  m  otherwise.
            Before entry with  TRANSA = 'N' or 'n',  the leading  m by k
            part of the array  A  must contain the matrix  A,  otherwise
            the leading  k by m  part of the array  A  must contain  the
            matrix A.
            Unchanged on exit.
   LDA    - INTEGER.
            On entry, LDA specifies the first dimension of A as declared
            in the calling (sub) program. When  TRANSA = 'N' or 'n' then
            LDA must be at least  max( 1, m ), otherwise  LDA must be at
            least  max( 1, k ).
            Unchanged on exit.
   B      - DOUBLE PRECISION array of DIMENSION ( LDB, kb ), where kb is
            n  when  TRANSB = 'N' or 'n',  and is  k  otherwise.
            Before entry with  TRANSB = 'N' or 'n',  the leading  k by n
            part of the array  B  must contain the matrix  B,  otherwise
            the leading  n by k  part of the array  B  must contain  the
            matrix B.
            Unchanged on exit.
   LDB    - INTEGER.
            On entry, LDB specifies the first dimension of B as declared
            in the calling (sub) program. When  TRANSB = 'N' or 'n' then
            LDB must be at least  max( 1, k ), otherwise  LDB must be at
            least  max( 1, n ).
            Unchanged on exit.
   BETA   - DOUBLE PRECISION.
            On entry,  BETA  specifies the scalar  beta.  When  BETA  is
            supplied as zero then C need not be set on input.
            Unchanged on exit.
   C      - DOUBLE PRECISION array of DIMENSION ( LDC, n ).
            Before entry, the leading  m by n  part of the array  C must
            contain the matrix  C,  except when  beta  is zero, in which
            case C need not be set on entry.
            On exit, the array  C  is overwritten by the  m by n  matrix
            ( alpha*op( A )*op( B ) + beta*C ).
   LDC    - INTEGER.
            On entry, LDC specifies the first dimension of C as declared
            in  the  calling  (sub)  program.   LDC  must  be  at  least
            max( 1, m ).
            Unchanged on exit.
