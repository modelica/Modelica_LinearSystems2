<p>
All size information for plotting, such as width or height
of a window or the thickness of a line, are defined by type <strong>DrawingUnit_mm</strong>. The
recommended interpretation is that the DrawingUnit is the unscaled size in a document or
on printer in [mm]. For example, if the width of a diagram is 120,
and the diagram is pasted into a Word or PowerPoint document,
then the width of the diagram in the document is 120 mm.
