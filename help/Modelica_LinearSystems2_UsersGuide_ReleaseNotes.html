<p>
This is a new library. It is based on library Modelica_LinearSystems2 (version 0.95)
but is not backwards compatible to this library due to many changes (e.g. the system
data structures include strings for signals names whereas the 0.95 version does not
have these names in the records). Most important improvements with respect to version 0.95:
</p>
 
<ul>
<li> The library has been extended and contains now about 180 functions and a lot of examples for the analysis and design of linear control systems in different description forms.</li>
<li> The library has been restructured and the functions are now organized in sub packages.</li> 
<li>  Documentation has been upgraded and improved.</li> 
<li>  Operator overloading concept has been fully utilized.</li> 
<li>  Analysis functions like tests for controllability, observability, stabilizability, and detectability have been added.</li> 
<li>      The analyse-function to determine the characteristic of a system and to analyse the relation of the system states to the dynamics of the uncoupled modal states is provided.</li>
<li>      Calculation of invariant zeros for arbitrary systems (i.e. systems with different numbers of inputs and outputs) is now provided.</li> 
<li>      The Design package contains functions for controller design, i.e. pole assignment, LQ controller, Kalman Filter, and LQG controller.</li> 
<li>      Since the design of optimal controllers is based on the solution of algebraic Riccati equation, a solver for those equations is provided in Math.Matrices. Also an algorithm to solve Lyapunov equations has been added.</li> 
<li>      The package Sampled was renamed to Controller. All blocks are now available in a discrete representation,
          especially also the "Filter" block (was only available in a continuous representation in 0.95)</li> 
<li>      The Controller package contains a sub package Template which provides standard controller structures (e.g. a state-feedback-control-structure and a two degree of freedom controller template with an inverse system model in the feed forward loop) with replaceable components.</li> 
<li>      The besselFilter coefficients have been recalculated with high precision calculation up to order 41.</li>
<li>      LimPID, comprising P, PI, PD, and PID controller with limited output, anti-windup compensation and input weighting (setpoint and measured value) added.</li> 
<li>      Improved new generic plot functions are used for time and frequency plots.</li> 
<li> New system transformations (similarity transformation, canonical forms).</li>
<li> New transformations between system descriptions added, especially from
     ZerosAndPoles to StateSpace and from TransferFunction to StateSpace.</li>
<li> Generate condensed forms like Hessenberg description </li>
<li> Controllability/Observability forms</li>
<li> Time response with plot (step, ramp, impulse)</li>
<li> Bode plots improved, since the transformation from StateSpace to ZerosAndPoles
     uses a better algorithm from the newest LAPACK version.</li>
<li> Based on a newer LAPACK version 3.1.1.</li>
</ul>

<p>
First Beta-Version of the library. 
</p>
<p>
The Modelica_LinearSystems2.Controller library (previously called Modelica_LinearSystems.Sampled) is based on the
Sampled library from Nico Walther (master thesis 
from the electrical engineering at the HTWK-Leipzig,
supervised by Prof. M&uuml;ller, HTWK, and Prof. Martin Otter, DLR).
Based on the experience in using the Sampled library, 
new features in Modelica as well as in Dymola, 
the Sampled library was considerably restructured, and
newly implemented. The following main changes have been 
performed:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The library is based on the input/output signal connectors
     of the Modelica standard library 2.1 (and higher). Previously,
     it was based on version 1.6. Similar as in 2.1, all blocks
     have been de-vectorized (more convenient for the user in the
     standard case. Modelica allows now easy vectorization of 
     blocks).</li>
<li> The previous parameter "method" was split into "blockType" (continuous/discrete)
     and "methodType" (discretization method). It is therefore
     easier to switch between a continuous and a discrete representation because
     one does not have to remember which discretization method was used 
     previously when switching from a continuous to a discrete representation.</li> 
<li> The main options (blockType, methodType, sampleTime, initType) are set
     globally in component SampleClock via inner/outer and no longer in every
     component. The default defined in SampleClock can be changed in every
     component. Since in many cases just the defaults are used, it is now
     much more convenient to define the sampling setting and
     switch between different representations.</li>
<li> In every component, the Integer parameter sampleFactor is present that
     defines the sampling time of this component as a "sampleFactor" 
     multiple of the base sample time defined in sampleClock.
     This allows a more easier definition of standard multi-rate
     systems (in the previous version, in every component the actual
     sample time had to be defined). In the future, more advanced
     sampling options might be added, e.g., via user definable
     trigger signals.</li>
<li> The previous Filter sublibrary was replaced by two components
     <b>Filter</b> and <b>FilterFIR</b> that model IIR and FIR filter.
     There are now more options for IIR filters (additional Bessel
     filter + normalized/non-normalized filters).</li>
<li> The previous NoiseGenerators sublibrary was replaced by
     component <b>Noise</b>. In most applications only this Noise
     component is needed in sampled data systems and not the other
     variants in the previous NoiseGenerator library. It is then
     easier for a user to just select this component and not
     be forced to first figure out what component to use.</li>
<li> The discrete representations of the blocks are changed such that
     no past values of the input signals u are accessed. For linear systems
     this is always possible via a state transformation. The benefit is
     that it is easier to initialize the block. Previously,
     it was necessary to define somehow the initial values of pre(u).
     This was not always made in a consistent way. Since in the new version
     no pre(u) is present, it need not be initialized.</li>
<li> The sampling definition was changed. Previously, some when clauses have been
     evaluated during initialization and via the sample() operator at the
     initial time again (i.e., the when block was evaluated twice at
     the start time). Some blocks have not been evaluated during initialization and
     therefore in some cases the discrete variables have been not properly
     initialized. In the new version, all when-clauses are active during
     initialization and they are evaluated again at the next sample time:
     <pre>
     <b>when</b> {<b>initial</b>(), <b>sample</b>(Ts,Ts)} <b>then</b>
         // active during initialization and at time = Ts, 2*Ts, 3*Ts, ...
       ...
     <b>end when</b>;
     </pre>
     Furthermore, parameter startTime was removed (= first sample time of
     when-clause after the initialization) since this is nearly never needed
     in a practical application and therefore this parameter could be 
     removed (and no longer confuses users).</li> 
<li> The continuous representations of all blocks are implemented such that
     as much struture as possible is preserved in order that index reduction
     is possible. For example, if a transfer function has more poles as
     zeros, then the output of the block might be differentiated n times
     (n = number of poles - number of zeros) without introducing derivatives
     in the inputs. A detailed explanation is given at the end of the info
     layer of component
     <A HREF="Modelica_LinearSystems2_Controller.html#Modelica_LinearSystems2.Controller.ZerosAndPoles"
>ZerosAndPoles</a>.
     Previously, transfer functions and especially filters did not have this
     feature. Therefore, it was not possible to use the filters of the previous
     Sampled library as pre-filters in an inverse model. This is now
     possible. In such a case, a Bessel filter is most appropriate, because
     it does not introduce osciallations as the Butterworth and Chebyhev
     filter do and it is faster as the critical damping filter, see the
     description of the <A HREF="Modelica_LinearSystems2_Design.html#Modelica_LinearSystems2.ZerosAndPoles.Design.filter"
>filter</a> 
     function. Previously, a Bessel filter was not supported.
     </li>
<li> Previously, blocks have been implement with a large if-clause in which
     the different representations have been defined. In the new version, 
     the discrete representations are defined in a separate block that
     are activated via a conditional declaration, if the block is discrete.
     (conditional declarations have been only recently introduced into
     the Modelica language version 2.2). The benefit is that the implementation
     is simpler and that there is no longer any overhead for the continuous
     block (all equations and variables from the discrete representation
     are removed during translation).</li>
<li> Previously, for all simple blocks (such as FirstOrder) the different
     discrete representations have been specifially derived and implemented.
     In the new version, all blocks are first transformed to
     state space form with a function call and then the 
     discrete state space system block is used for the discrete
     representation. This approach is less error prone and
     the implementation is much simpler.</li>
<li> Special data structures for linear systems have been introduced
     in form of records and accompanying functions operating on these
     records. As a result, also the input parameters of some blocks,
     such as StateSpace or TransferFunction are now records instead
     of arrays. It is then possible to generate such system representations
     by appropriate function calls and supply the result as record
     instance to the corresponding block.</li> 
</ul>
